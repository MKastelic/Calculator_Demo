# Calculator_Demo
Simple calculator using CircuitPython

Input:  The current version of this implementation of a simple calculator in CircuitPython is configured for a 4x4 matrix keypad.  However, the program is capable of supporting larger keypads.  If a 4x5 matrix keypad is available, the program can support the additional key functions for:  negation (+/-), percent (%), and subtraction (-).

Output:  For testing purposes, the output is currently limited to print statements, allowing the display to be read from a serial communications terminal.  Future work will include interfacing to eINK display hardware.
